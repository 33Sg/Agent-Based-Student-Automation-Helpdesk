# 🎓 GENOVA: Agent-Based Admission Automation Framework

**Welcome to a smarter way of handling student admissions!**  
GENOVA is a collaborative, AI-powered platform designed to automate the entire admission workflow—from handling applicant queries and document verification to eligibility checks and financial aid processing.

By combining intelligent agents with a modular architecture, GENOVA minimizes manual effort and makes admissions faster, smarter, and more reliable.
