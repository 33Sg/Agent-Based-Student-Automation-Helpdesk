🎓 Agent-Based Admission Automation Framework (GENOVA)
Welcome to a smarter way of handling student admissions!
GENOVA is a collaborative, AI-powered platform built to automate the entire admission process—from handling inquiries and verifying documents to checking eligibility and processing financial aid. By combining intelligent agents with modular design, this system reduces manual effort and makes admissions faster, smarter, and more reliable.

🌟 What This Project Does
This framework leverages intelligent software agents, each responsible for a core admission function:

📬 Answering applicant queries using NLP

📄 Validating uploaded documents with rule-based checks

✅ Evaluating student eligibility criteria

💰 Managing financial aid requests and fee slip generation

It integrates advanced tools like OpenAI’s large language models, ChromaDB for semantic search, and SQLite for structured logic handling.

🤝 Teamwork & Collaboration
GENOVA was developed as a group project, showcasing the importance of clear communication, role delegation, and seamless integration across modules. Each team member led specific agents/modules, and I contributed to both development and coordination efforts. Working together, we translated a complex real-world problem into a scalable tech solution.

💡 Why It Matters
Student admissions often involve repetitive, error-prone processes. GENOVA helps educational institutions:

Minimize delays and manual work

Improve the applicant experience

Enable smarter decisions using AI insights

Easily scale as student volumes grow
