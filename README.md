# 🎓 Agent-Based Admission Automation Framework

Welcome to a smarter way of handling student admissions!  
This project is built to automate the entire admission process—from handling inquiries and verifying documents to checking eligibility and processing financial aid. By combining the power of AI with a modular agent-based design, this system reduces manual effort and makes admissions faster, smarter, and more reliable.

## 🌟 What This Project Does

This framework uses intelligent software agents, each focused on a specific part of the admission pipeline:

- 📬 Answering applicant questions
- 📄 Validating uploaded documents
- ✅ Checking eligibility based on rules
- 💰 Managing financial aid and fee slip generation

It integrates modern tools like **OpenAI’s large language models**, **ChromaDB** for semantic search, and **SQLite** for structured decision-making.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Admissions can be complicated and time-consuming. This system helps universities and colleges reduce delays, avoid errors, and improve the experience for both administrators and students. The modular setup also makes it easy to scale and adapt for future needs.
